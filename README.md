# Basic Text Adventure Game in Rust

This is my first project in Rust, so I decised to make a basic text adventure game. Initially I couldn't find any suitable example source code about text games in Rust, so I started from scratch. I did however find some useful source code about the **match** keyword:
>match - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31541442/how-do-i-match-on-a-string-read-from-standard-input

## Compiling the program

Obviously you will require the Rust compiler installed on your computer of choice. I tested it on both Windows and Linux, so it should also work on a Mac. I kept it really simple using the standard library, but you could use cargo if you want. To compile the program type the following in your Terminal of choice:

>rustc rust_text_game.rs

Once complied you should then be able to run the executable that was created.

This text game is far from finished, but I thought it may be helpful for others who are starting to use Rust. I hope you enjoy my humour!
